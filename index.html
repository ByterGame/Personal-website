            <div class="Information">Born on March 16, 2006, in a small village in the Republic of SAKHA (Yakutia).
                <br>My hobbies include programming (especially game development),
                drawing (I've been interested in this for the last couple of months at the time of writing),
                3D modeling (although, to be honest, I haven't practiced in a while), football, table tennis, poker,
                and I love lying on the grass and looking at the stars with thoughts like: "My actions won't change anything anyway,
                so why should I limit myself? :)"

            <div class="Information">
                Around the 8th grade, I became interested in game development and dedicated over a year to mastering programming basics,
                the Unity engine, 3D modeling, and level design. However,
                I lost motivation for it in the 10th grade. After enrolling at FEFU in 2023, I re-entered the IT environment,
                participated in various hackathons and competitions, and developed a small game with a group of friends for a three-day gamejam,
                strengthened my theoretical knowledge and am happily learning new things in this field!
